# Overview
A team application should be the digital equivalent of the information package / tournament booklet combined with team specific information. Optionally this can include live updates from the other modules like scoring, schedueling. The target audience is maily the teams, couches and parents, but also an information channel to general visitors. An example is the US FIRST Championship app. http://www.firstchampionship.org/event-app

The initial implementation could be a mobile website served from a local host, available during the event itself. But in the future this could be packaged and deployed on a webserver so the information is also available before and after the event.

# Functions
## Static information
The majority of the informatino would be added by the tournament organizer before the event. This 'static' information contains general information about the events that won't change (much) during the event. I.e. all information that is normally printed and handed out to teams.
