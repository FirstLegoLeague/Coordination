# Overview
The purpose of this module is to provide a dyanmic display for general tournament information. At the moment there is a module called [displaySystems](https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/displaySystem) which is designed as an overlay on top of a video feed. This new module should provide ways for the tournament to display information in a more static way.

# Information Displays elements
It is easy to see how this module can grow from a stand alone display to show the schedule, results, tweets and so... to a centrally managed display system that can work together to provide the participants and visitors of a up to date and relevant information.

In a basic form we see a laptop connected to a screen/monitor. Therefor the module should provide a (full screen) output website and a control page. In a more eleborate scenario "the screens" can registar themselfs with each other so all screens can be managed from one location.

# Functions
1. Display the general scheduele
2. Display a match table scheduele (per table)
3. Display round scores (from scores module)
4. Display Tweets or other social channels (See this [jQuery Social Stream](https://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-social-stream/2103997) for a example. Also check out [the twitter admin](https://github.com/FirstLegoLeague/twitter-admin) software in this repro.
5. Provide a manage interface, for setting up cycle times and selecting input sources
