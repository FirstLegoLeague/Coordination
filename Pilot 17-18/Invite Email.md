Dear FLL Tournament organizer,

We hereby would like to invite you to pilot new software that is being developed for FIRST LEGO League tournaments. This software is being developed by an international group of dedicated volunteers. Over the past year(s) these volunteers have worked to develop a brand new, open-source suite of FLL software using the latest technologies. While the development is still going on, we wanted to ask you to help us test and further shape the software. 

Specifically, we want to invite you to pilot the new software 

You can find more information about the software, the functions and features on the website: http://www.fll-tools.com/ 



In case you need support, want to offer suggestions or are in need of a (virtual) hug, you can contact us via the following channels:
* Via the website (*Preferred*): http://www.fll-tools.com/support/
* By email: send an email to support@fll-tools.com
* If you want more direct interaction you can also connect on Slack, please contact us at support@fll-tools.com to get access.

When you need support, please make sure to include as many (relevant) details as possible. At least include: what were you trying to do, what error message (or system behaviour) you encountered, and what setup you use (hardware, network). Please remember that we are volunteers and while we try to help you as quickly as we can, there may be some delays. 

We hope you will have a awesome and fun FLL season!
On behalf on all the volunteers,
Alan Green (IL) and Kenny Meesters (NL)
